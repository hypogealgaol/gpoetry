Update: Changed to flickr API due to it being easier to use and not depracated

web search image api experiment with autofill pictures

Attempting: to create a fun web app that will autofill search terms with google image results and create a collage of some sort. 
Here's the gameplan

  
* get an image search result using flickr image search (DONE)
* load image and readjust the size, preferabbly small squares
* fill / delete it inline as text is written and erased or below in an image area
* ...
* eventually sync w/phonegap, allow for animations 

I'm mostly using this little experiment to further familiarize myself with CSS/HTML/JS/API usage

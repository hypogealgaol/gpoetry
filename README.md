Google image api experiment with autofill word search

Attempting: to create a fun web app that will autofill search terms with google image results and create a collage of some sort. 
Here's the gameplan

  
* get an image search result using 'depracated' image search API from textarea
* load image and readjust the size
* fill / delete it inline as text is written and erased

I'm mostly using this to further familiarize myself with CSS/HTML/JS/GAPI
